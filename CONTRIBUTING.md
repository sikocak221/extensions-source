# Contributing

Extensions are small TypeScript projects that run in Matane's sandbox (QuickJS, no Node.js APIs, network only through the app). The SDK reference is the README of [`@matane/extension-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matane/extension-sdk) on npm.

## Setup

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test                 # every extension, against recorded fixtures
pnpm repo:build:unsigned  # build the whole repository into public/, as it would be published
```

## A new extension

```sh
cd src/en   # src/<lang>/<id> like Tachiyomi; multi-language sites go in src/all
pnpm exec mr-ext create my-site --name "My Site" --domain my-site.example --lang en --layout catalog
```

`--layout catalog` takes the `@matane/*` versions from the workspace catalog and extends the root `tsconfig.base.json`. Then run `pnpm install` from the root.

Develop with the app: Extensions → **Load from folder** → `src/en/my-site` (after `pnpm build`; it hot-reloads on every build), and **View logs** for its requests and errors. Check the whole reading flow against the real site with `pnpm exec mr-ext test src/en/my-site`.

## Checklist for a pull request

- [ ] `id` is new, lowercase, without a language, and will never change.
- [ ] `version` in `manifest.json` is higher than the published one (CI checks this).
- [ ] `nsfw` is `true` for adult sites.
- [ ] `rateLimit` follows the site's rules.
- [ ] `url` values are stable. If their form changes, `migrateUrl` handles every older version.
- [ ] `icon.png`: square, 96–256 px, at most 512 KB.
- [ ] Tests with recorded fixtures (`MR_RECORD=1 pnpm test`; fixtures are not committed), and `mr-ext test` passes against the real site.
- [ ] No paywall bypass, and nothing the site's terms forbid.

## Publishing

Merging to `main` publishes: CI builds every extension, signs the index with this repository's key (the `MR_REPO_KEY` secret) and deploys it to GitHub Pages. Nobody signs anything by hand, and an unsigned or wrongly signed repository is never published.
